    "- you just need to return the total sum amount, not the sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "    ## For Example:\n",
    "    - [7, 8, 9] the answer is 7 + 8 + 9 = 24\n",
    "    - [-1, 7, 8, 9, -10] the answer is 7 + 8 + 9 = 24\n",
    "    - [2, 3, -10, 9, 2] the answer is 9 + 2 = 11\n",
    "    - [2, 11, -10, 9, 2] tricky here, we can offset the \"cost\" of the -10 by including the 11 to its left, so we are going to include all the numbers\n",
    "        - so 2 + 11 + -10 + 9 + 2 = 14\n",

    "- the algorithm is, we start summing up the numbers and store them in a current sum variable__\n",
    "- after adding each element, we check whether the current sum is larger than the maximum sum encountered thus far\n",

    "- as long as the current sum is positive, we keep adding the numbers\n",
    "- when the current sum becomes negative, we start with a new current sum\n",
    "    - becuase a negative current sum will only decrease the sum of a future sequence\n",
    "- we don't reset the current sum to 0 becuase the array can contain all negative numbers \n",
    "    - then the result would be the largest negative number!"
